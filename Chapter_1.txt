TCP: Transmission Protocol Network
IP: Internet Protocol

1.1 

Internet is the ability to provide communication and the WWW is an app that uses the Internet

Packet Switching: Packets are sent on different paths across the internet and reconstructed.
Use a buffer memory to reconstruct. Multiplexing helps share one delivery route (or connection) between many senders and receivers.

End to End Argument + Fate Sharing: TCP/IP is designed around the end-to-end argument: the network stays simple, and the complexity is handled at the ends — making it powerful, adaptable, and reliable for everything from texts to space missions. 
If one endpoint (like your computer) fails or disconnects, it’s okay to lose the connection info or any in-progress data, because the other side can’t use it anymore anyway.
