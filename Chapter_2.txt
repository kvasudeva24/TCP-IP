2.1 to 2.2

IPv4 is a 32 bit address seperated into 4 8bit chunks like
123.456.789.012

IPv6 uses hexadecimal 0-9 and a-f for each digit so it is 8 chunks of 4characters
You need 128 bits to encode. 16bits per chunk and 8 chunks = 128.


2.3

IPs were originally broken down into 5 classes A - E. 
Replaced classful addressing to allow more flexible subnetting.
IPs are paired with a subnet mask to define the network (subnet) prefix.
Use a bitwise AND mask to find the subnet prefix for a unicast system
For a broadcast system, invert the bitmask and OR it with the address to find the broadcast subnet prefix.
Masks can be denoted by /x where x is the number of 1s the mask starts with
