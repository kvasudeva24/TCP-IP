2.1 to 2.2

IPv4 is a 32 bit address seperated into 4 8bit chunks like
123.456.789.012

IPv6 uses hexadecimal 0-9 and a-f for each digit so it is 8 chunks of 4characters
You need 128 bits to encode. 16bits per chunk and 8 chunks = 128.


2.3

IPs were originally broken down into 5 classes A - E. 
Replaced classful addressing to allow more flexible subnetting.
IPs are paired with a subnet mask to define the network (subnet) prefix.
Use a bitwise AND mask to find the subnet prefix for a unicast system
For a broadcast system, invert the bitmask and OR it with the address to find the broadcast subnet prefix.
Masks can be denoted by /x where x is the number of 1s the mask starts with

2.4
Introdcution to CIDR and we got rid of the class method
CIDR helps keep track of using only what you need in a tree structure
Aggregation makes routing tables smarter and faster
So if you break 192.168.0.0/16 into:

192.168.0.0/24

192.168.1.0/24

...

Youâ€™re just making branches and twigs from the big tree.

You keep going until you get a /32 IP address which means you are at a leaf and is an IP address that is being used
